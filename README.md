This is another JS/jQuery online course follow-along project.
Not original, just something to work on so that I can learn.

Rules of the game:
Watch and listen for the generated button to signal by flashing and make a sound.
Each color button will have their own sound.
Remember the entire sequence of signals in the correct order and you will level up!
If you get it wrong, it's game over =( You will restart at Level 1.

As always, looking foward to coming back to this project and seeing what I can add in the future!
In the meantime, will keep pushing forward on my online course to acquire new material!

Feel free to explore and have fun.
