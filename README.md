Landing page game called Simon, remember the colors in sequential order and reach the highest level! Built with JavaScript

Rules of the game:
Watch and listen for the button to generate a signal by flashing and making a sound.
Each color button will have their own unique sound.
Remember the entire sequence in the correct order and you will level up!
If you get it wrong, it's game over =( You will restart at Level 1.

This project was built with the objective of learning more about JavaScript, and specifically jQuery.

As always, looking foward to coming back to this in the future and seeing what else I can add.
In the meantime, moving forward with more projects.

Feel free to explore, use and have fun.
